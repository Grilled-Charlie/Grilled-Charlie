- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Grilled-Charlie
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in absolutely everything.
- Iâ€™m currently learning about new developments with CSS and while catching up I'm also starting fresh with JavaScript.
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything, even as just an ideaboard. I'm a jack of all tades but master of none - yet. 
  I'm currently a Business/Accounting tutor while finishing my degree in business administration.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: For now through GitHub is fine and we can go from there.
